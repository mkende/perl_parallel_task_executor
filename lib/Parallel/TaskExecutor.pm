=head1 NAME

Parallel::TaskExecutor

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Cross-platform executor for parallel tasks executed in forked processes.

  my $executor = Parallel::TaskExecutor->new();
  my $task = $executor->run(sub { return 'foo' });
  $task->wait();
  is($task->data(), 'foo');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a simple interface to run Perl code in forked processes and
receive the result of their processing. This is quite similar to
L<Parallel::ForkManager> with a different OO approach, more centered on the task
object that can be seen as a very lightweight promise.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 constructor

  my $executor = Parallel::TaskExecutor->new(%options);

Create a new executor. The main possible option is:

=over 4

=item *

B<max_parallel_tasks> (default = 4): how many different sub-processes
can be created in total by this object instance.

=back

But all the options that can be passed to run() can also be passed to new() and
they will apply to all the calls to this object.

=cut

Readonly::Scalar my $default_max_parallel_tasks => 4;

sub new {
  my ($class, %options) = @_;
  my $this = bless {
    max_parallel_tasks => $options{max_parallel_tasks} // $default_max_parallel_tasks,
    options => \%options,
    current_tasks => 0,
    zombies => [],  # Store all the non-done tasks whose other reference went out of scope.
    tasks => {},  # Stores all the non-done tasks, as a weak reference.
    pid => $PID,
    log => $log,
  }, $class;
  return $this;
}

=pod

=head2 destructor

When a B<Parallel::TaskExecutor> goes out of scope, its destructor will wait
for all the tasks that it started and for which the returned task object is not
live. This is a complement to the destructor of L<Parallel::TaskExecutor::Task>
which waits for a task to be done if its parent executor is no longer live.

=cut

sub DESTROY {
  my ($this) = @_;
  # TODO: consider if this is the correct thing to do or if we should instead
  # wait for the task here.
  return if ${^GLOBAL_PHASE} eq 'DESTRUCT';
  return unless $PID == $this->{pid};
  for my $c (@{$this->{zombies}}) {
    # TODO: add an option to abandon the children (but they must be awaited by
    # someone).
    $c->wait();
  }
  return;
}

=pod

=head2 default_executor()

  my $executor = default_executor();

Returns a default B<Parallel::TaskExecutor> object with an unspecified
parallelism (guaranteed to be more than 1 parallel tasks).

=head2 run()

  my $task = $executor->run($sub, %options);

Fork a new child process and use it to execute the given I<$sub>. The execution
can be tracked using the returned I<$task> object of type
L<Parallel::TaskManager::Task>.

If there are already B<max_parallel_tasks> tasks running, then the call will
block until the count of running tasks goes below that limit.

The possible options are the following:

=over 4

=item *

B<SIG> (hash-reference): if provided, this specifies a set of signal
handlers to be set in the child process. These signal handler are installed
before the provided I<$sub> is called and before the call to run() returns.

=item *

B<wait>: if set to a true value, the call to run will wait for the task
to be complete before returning (this means that C<$task->done()> will always be
true when you get the task).

=item *

B<catch_error>: by default, a failure of a child task will abort the parent
process. If this option is set to true, the failure will be reported by the task
instead.

=item *

B<scalar>: when set to true, the I<$sub> is called in scalar context. Otherwise
it is called in list context.

=item *

B<forced>: if set to true, the task will be run immediately, even if this means
exceeding the value for the B<max_parallel_tasks> passed to the constructor.
Note however that the task will still increase by one the number of running
tasks tracked by the executor (unless B<untracked> is also set to true).

=item *

B<untracked>: if set to true, the task will not increase the number of running
task counted by the executor. However, the call to run() might still be blocked
if the number of outstanding tasks exceeds B<max_parallel_tasks> (unless
B<forced> is set to true too).

=back

=cut

Readonly::Scalar my $busy_loop_wait_time_us => 1000;

sub run {
  my ($this, $sub, %options) = @_;
  %options = (%{$this->{options}}, %options);
  if (!$options{forced}) {
    usleep($busy_loop_wait_time_us) while $this->{current_tasks} >= $this->{max_parallel_tasks};
  }
  return $this->_fork_and_run($sub, %options);
}

=pod

=head2 run_now()

  my $data = $executor->run_now($sub, %options);

Runs the given I<$sub> in a forked process and waits for its result. This never
blocks (the I<$sub> is run even if the executor max parallelism is already
reached) and this does not increase the counted parallelism of the executor
either (in effect the B<untracked>, B<forced>, and B<wait> options are set to
true).

In addition, the B<scalar> option is set to true if this method is called in
scalar context, unless that option was explicitly passed to the run_now() call.

=cut

sub run_now {
  my ($this, $sub, %options) = @_;
  $options{scalar} = 1 unless exists $options{scalar} || wantarray;
  my $task = $this->_fork_and_run($sub, %options, untracked => 1, wait => 1);
  $task->wait();
  return $task->data();
}

=pod

=head2 wait()

  $executor->wait();

Waits for all the outstanding tasks to terminate. This waits for all the tasks
independently of whether their L<Parallel::TaskExecutor::Task> object is still
live.

=cut

sub wait {  ## no critic (ProhibitBuiltinHomonyms)
  my ($this) = @_;
  my $nb_children = $this->{current_tasks};
  return unless $nb_children;
  $this->{log}->debug("Waiting for ${nb_children} running tasks...");
  while (my $c = shift @{$this->{zombies}}) {
    $c->wait();
  }
  while (my (undef, $c) = each %{$this->{tasks}}) {
    # $c is a weak reference, but it is never undef because the task will remove
    # itself from this hash in its DESTROY method.
    # $c->wait() will delete this entry from the hash, but this is legal when
    # looping with each.
    $c->wait();
  }
  return;
}

=pod

=head2 set_max_parallel_tasks()

  $executor->set_max_parallel_tasks(N)

Sets the B<max_parallel_tasks> option of the executor.

=cut

sub set_max_parallel_tasks {
  my ($this, $max_parallel_tasks) = @_;
  $this->{max_parallel_tasks} = $max_parallel_tasks;
  return;
}
